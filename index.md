## Work Experience

### Software Development Engineer Intern | Summer 2020
Interned with Amazon's Item Catalog team over the summer and gained experience working with a great group of programmers. Working at Amazon allowed me to learn how to use Agile development principles in a professional coding environment. I worked on a project that dealt with database handling and researched appropriate technologies to support our goal in implementing a beta version of the project to present to the team.

### Teaching Assistant | Summer 2019 & Fall 2019
For the past two semesters, I've been a Teaching Assistant in the College of
Computing at Georgia Tech assisting with the course CS1331, Introduction to
Object Oriented Programming. I really enjoy assisting with this class as a lot of
students in it have no prior experience with coding, and this course is a great way
to spark their interest.

## Volunteer Experience

### Catalyst | Spring 2019
I took part in this HackGT (an organization at Georgia Tech dedicated to promoting CS education) event where we invited high school students to campus to learn about what a career in CS can look like. Each student had the chance to pick which 'track' they were interested in. I participated in the design pathway. For this track, we took them through a project which introduced the idea of individual pixels, how they store color values, and how you can manipulate them.
