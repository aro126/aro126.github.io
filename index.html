        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm in my 3rd year at Georgia Tech, and I've spent the past two semesters working as a Teaching Assistant there. My main
            interests lie in Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and UI design. I'm seeking an internship or co-op for Spring 2020, 
            Summer 2020, and Fall 2020.</p>

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <h3>Teaching Assistant | Summer 2019 & Fall 2019</h3>
    <p>For the past two semesters, I've been a Teaching Assistant in the College of 
    Computing at Georgia Tech assisting with the course CS1331, Introduction to 
    Object Oriented Programming. I really enjoy assisting with this class as a lot of 
    students in it have no prior experience with coding, and this course is a great way
    to spark their interest.</p>

    <h2>Extracurricular Experience</h2>
    <h3>Georgia Tech Lorraine Study Abroad | Fall 2018 </h3>
    <p>I had the oppurtunity to participate in Georgia Tech's study abroad program
    and live in Metz, France for 4 months. While there, I traveled to various countries
    and had to the chance to see the Louvre, the EU parliament building in Strasbourg, and 
      Notre-Dame.</p>
    <h3>Catalyst | Spring 2019</h3>
    <p>I took part in this HackGT (an organization at Georgia Tech dedicated to 
    to promoting CS education) event where we invited high school students to 
    campus to learn about what a career in CS can look like. Each student had the 
    chance to pick which 'track' they were interested in. I participated in the
    design pathway. For this track, we took them through a project which introduced 
    the idea of individual pixels, how they store color values, and how you can 
    manipulate them. I hope to participate in this event again next year.</p>
