Working at Amazon allowed me to learn how to use Agile development principles in a professional coding environment. I worked on a project that dealt with database handling and researched appropriate technologies to support our goal as well as implemented a beta stage version of the project to present to the team.</p>

                        <p>For the past two semesters, I've been a Teaching Assistant in the College of
                            Computing at Georgia Tech assisting with the course CS1331, Introduction to
                            Object Oriented Programming. I really enjoy assisting with this class as a lot of
                            students in it have no prior experience with coding, and this course is a great way
                            to spark their interest.</p>

            <h2>Extracurricular Experience</h2>
            <h3>Catalyst | Spring 2019</h3>
            <p>I took part in this HackGT (an organization at Georgia Tech dedicated to
                to promoting CS education) event where we invited high school students to
                campus to learn about what a career in CS can look like. Each student had the
                chance to pick which 'track' they were interested in. I participated in the
                design pathway. For this track, we took them through a project which introduced
                the idea of individual pixels, how they store color values, and how you can
                manipulate them. I hope to participate in this event again next year.</p>
